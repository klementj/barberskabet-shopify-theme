# Slate-Bootstrap Theme

> **[Slate v1](https://github.com/Shopify/slate) is currently in beta!** You should expect potentially breaking changes between updates and more bugs than a finalized release. Slate v1.0 has not yet been tested on Windows.

This is the theme I wish had been available when I was rolling my own integration of Bootstrap 4 into a custom Shopify store

I've started with the base [Shopify/skeleton-theme](https://github.com/Shopify/starter-theme) and brought over most of the ```/src``` directory of [Shopify/starter-theme](https://github.com/Shopify/skeleton-theme), and some of ```src/styles```. These default Shopify styles are being gradually refactored out of the theme as I have time. PRs welcome!

For responsive image loading, use the ```responsive-image``` & ```responsive-bg-image``` snippets. They pair well with Bootstrap's responsive classes, and the lazyloader dependancy is built into the theme.

### Typopgrapy

This theme is intended to be used with Montserrat Bold for headings and Harmonica Sans for body text. Both of these can be set using the Shopify admin theme editor. You may need to make adjustments in typography.scss if other font pairings are used.

### jQuery & Webpack
Because Bootstrap requires jQuery, additional setup is required in ```theme.js```. For discussion, see Webpack issue [#4258](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/4258).

To add plugins to the theme, such as [jackmoore/zoom](https://github.com/jackmoore/zoom), take a look at [this gist](https://gist.github.com/neckerson/fd24e76e5c3f38d5aef83baadd09d28b) which is implemented in ```theme.js```. Image zoom is implemented in sections/product.liquid

## System requirements

You'll want to ensure you have the following already installed on your local machine before getting started with the Slate-Bootstrap theme:

* **Node:** The current LTS (long-term support) release. We like to use a Node Version Manager like [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

* **NPM 5+ or Yarn:** Both of these package managers have [ups and downs](https://blog.risingstack.com/yarn-vs-npm-node-js-package-managers/), choose whichever you prefer. Follow the installation instructions [for Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) or [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) to make sure you're using the latest version.

## Getting started

To get started with the Slate-Bootstrap theme, run the following command in your terminal:

```
$ yarn create slate-theme my-new-theme neckerson/slate-bootstrap-theme
```
